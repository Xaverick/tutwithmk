                    <p>"Sufferings" are a part of life – But, some people want to achieve Distinction in that! Congrats to them all, as they succeeded & made 'Sufferings' a good 80% part of their lives. But the hot news is: Some wanted to be part of that Inner Circle so they went ahead & scored 95%!! (Bravo – Cheersss, Applause).</p>
                    <p>Well, no shame in admitting: I was one of them... and if you are too... Yeah! Let's share a smile & a nod together my friend :))</p>

                    <p>I can't give myself alone the whole credit. With utmost certainty I can point out, few people & incidents from my life, which made sure I achieved that score! And... ok, let's kick them aside for a moment & we use our 'see through glasses' to channel our attention on:</p>
                    <p>Something Genius — Mind.</p>
                    <p>Mind in raw terms, is an accumulation of memories. Part of which turned, out-of-control, creating a Havoc; A Rebel on loose creating disintegration of self with the greetings, "Welcome to Hell.</p>
                    <p>Inside Hell: Putting a leash on those past rough & painful moments or even present emotional sufferings – Isn't achieved via. "prayers" accompanied with Offerings of: Sedatives, nicotine, alcohol or LSDs – so stop playing footsie with it, 'coz these along with others & so called counseling gimmicks, Advancely Confuses & Distorts – this time – not only that rebel part of your mind, but – Your Entire Logical Mind! </p>
                    <p>Makes some sense so far? </p>

                <p>The standpoint from where you are — You Both Are. Then why conflicts, disagreements, mis-emotions, feeling of ill will, vengeance etc.</p>
                <p>“Lack of Acknowledgement.”</p>
                <p>The only ingredient above Right or Wrong ever there was, is: “Acknowledgement”.</p>
                <p>In other words before something could be considered and stated right or wrong — 1st comes — “Acknowledgement.”</p>
                <p>How does it go? We need to get the true meaning of the word 1st:</p>
                <p>“Acknowledgement”: “To take notice of. To make known the receipt of.” (Merriam-Webster Dictionary.)</p>
                <p>In essence it is letting the other person know that whatever he’s saying or feeling — has been Noted and Understood. Both written and verbal communications are participated-in by an Acknowledgement.</p>
                <p>For example Jason and Smith are colleagues in a Company:</p>
                <p>Joe: “My life has many issues: family, money, health and of course promotion.”</p>
                <p>Peter: “I can relate to that.” (Acknowledgement.)</p>
                <p>Joe: “We’re having a family get together this weekend.”</p>
                <p>Peter: “That’s Great.” (Acknowledgement.)</p>
                <p>Now let’s see a few examples with NO Acknowledgement:</p>
                <p>Peter: “I’m having a severe headache today.”</p>
                <p>John: “You still have to finish the job.” (No Acknowledgement.)</p>
                <p>John: “I think I should start something at my own.”</p>
                <p>Peter: “Nice plan to be a bankrupt.” (No Acknowledgement.)</p>
                <p>Most people have never been introduced to the concept of “Acknowledgement” and because of their urge to participate in the conversation they end up commenting, making fun and at worst criticizing other person’s viewpoint.</p>
                <p><b>Good, Healthy Business and Social Communications — Start, Continue and End with Acknowledgements.</b></p>
                <p>Hope it was of some use.</p>

                <p>- H E L P -</p>
                <p>How does people look to you, when you are “Sad”?</p>
                <p>That’s how they look to me — Happy!!</p>
                <p>- When you are Sad everyone else seems to be “Happier” -</p>
                <p>When a person is Sad, and he looks outside the window or he is walking down the street or he is attending a party or is in any environment where there are people around him — he looks at these people and finds them — Happy!</p>
                <p>We are compassionate Beings! We look around and can see there are people who are stressed with the usual issues of work, money, health, family, society etc.</p>
                <p>But ironically, when You are Sad and you see these people, they look — Happy! What a shift, in the way one views.</p>
                <p>As you know: In the play called Life there are ups and downs And if you got a little more understanding of the Downs may be you won’t be hard on yourself or others.</p>
                <p>To Experiment: Next time you find yourself feeling Sad or it’s “one of those days” : <b>Just look at the people around you and see how they seem to you?</b></p>
                <p>Now as an experiment it’s fine but it isn’t any way out for someone who’s feeling “Sad or Low”?</p>
                <p><b>Let me tell you what I experienced today:</b> I got up in the morning and for some reason(which i don’t have a clue) was at an emotional low. I thought this might change after I got ready- but no luck- that feeling didn’t go away. Ate breakfast, hoping to feel the motor kicking in but — NO and I continued to still feel dispirited.</p>
                <p>Didn’t even want to Listen to Music! And I’m one of those people who likes to have the music playing even before I put on my seatbelt. So I decided to put in some hours of study hoping that the productivity would pull me up and out… Not much happened though.</p>
                <p>Now I was avoiding people and did not want to interact with them. Not because of them but because I did not want them to perceive me “Differently” to what they are used to.</p>
                <p>Now, what happened afterwards was interesting!!</p>
                <p>Later in that day, I met someone who was in trouble.</p>
                <p>As a doctor cannot be a patient when he sees a patient on the opposite side of the table; so being a ‘Personal Coach’, I met that person Professionally and offered a Personal Coaching Session.</p>
                <p>We started the session and we did 2 Practicals and he moved out of his Sad and Discouraged feelings! The problem that had brought him so low became just a problem that just needed a solution… which he shared with me. And seeing the brightness and smile on his face I knew I had done what was needed and ended the Session.</p>
                <p>So, What happened with me?</p>
                <p><b>My Day Changed!</b> There was no trace of sadness or whatever else was clouding me. I was Back!</p>
                <p>So, what did happen? What did I do?</p>
                <p><b>I Helped Someone Who Needed A Hand. </b> And in doing so, I got myself back in the Game! That’s All I Did.</p>
                <p> <b>Now, Another Practical Experiment you want try out: </b></p>
                <p>Situation: In a Bad Mood, Feeling Low or Sad.</p>
                <p>To Do: Find someone around you who might need a hand? Help him out. May be find another person and help him too a bit & over the call help someone with something too and unwrap all the WOWs awaiting for YOU.</p>
                <p>There might be many other ways to be Back in Top Gear, but I simply <b>Loved </b> this One!</p>

                <p>Tough, Uncertain, Changing Times -needs- Practical, Certain, Stable Grounds! <br /></p>
                <h2>Your Transformation only via. Your Performance 2.0</h2>
                <p>Why? If you think lockdown Affected people — because they were badly affected economically, only — then you’ve no idea what Bad is!</p>
                <p>It has sucked the Positive Living Energy of people down into the ground & many got buried in that ground.</p>
                <p>Known Consequences: Sucide, Depression, A decline in all kind of words that are prefixed with “Self-” like Self-confidence, Self-Trust etc. Fear, Anger, Anxiety, Arguments, Physical Abuses, Helplessness, Being an effect, Introversion, Thinking-Thinking, laziness, slowness of mind have been seen commonly around.</p>
                <p>Temporary Relief: Rescue is to keep yourself busy, do other works & remain distracted and away from “negativity”. Seems fair to me! Now, let’s see the real picture — for some people it worked for a week and for some a month & then the ship started sinking again.</p>
                <p>Now, has distraction been a real solution(which never is by the way) then at least people who were doing that would have been rescued for good. Isn’t it? But after sometime some people realized that basically this is not an individualistic situation — this is not their fault if they feel the earlier mentioned symptoms even after keeping themselves busy for a week or a month!</p>
                <p> <b>Mass Impact: </b>Understand that it’s happening at the mass level. That’s why for a week/month a person can distract himself but the collective impact gets him — the moment he stops the activity he has kept himself busy with! You must have seen it too.</p>
                <p> <b>Fact: </b> We’re not a machine who can be switched On and kept busy 24/7. As the overwhelm is in the environment & not in your head to begin with, it’s waiting for us to Stop being busy so it can get us and bring us under its shadow. On some the impact is more & on some it’s less but, but quietly it’s growing, growing continuously & making people psychologically weak.</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> Truth!</p>
                <p>Have you heard this: “Truth sets a person free.”</p>
                <p>Now is the needful time, you Find it… Else, the game might be Over for you because the people who know the Truth, only they will emerge Ruling & Winning!</p>
                <p>Where to find Truth? Ages old question & I give you the ages old answer: If all the Peace you’ll ever find lies in You… then that can not be far from — All the Truths you’ll ever find lies in You Too!</p>
                <p>So, What Transforms You?</p>
                <p> <b>Answer: </b>Your Truth! Not mine or some wise man’s truth — Your Truth!</p>
                <p><b>How?:</b> There is an Organized System a Technology to get the person find his own Truths & I’ve been doing that from past 18yrs uninterrupted. </p>
                <p>The old world of Quantity is fading out rapidly & Quality is emerging!</p>
                <p>Therefore You & Your Performance 2.0 is the prerequisite(mandatory) to be Back as a Player. Else, without your knowing & without giving you any recovery time you’ll slide out of the playing field. Some of you may think it’s imaginary or philosophical… My intention is not to make you feel less about your capabilities in anyways, But time has changed & will change further and if you keep doing the same things you will not get changed results, or will you? Version 1.0 of “You” needs upgrading Now!</p>
                <p><b>Success:</b> Even I had to Transform myself so that I don’t fall into the whirlpool. After emerging out with 100% Success, I’ve started to lift others out. I’m glad I can do that without imposing my own knowledge or someone else’s experience… And at the same time, Train the person find his/her own Truth because that’s the only way & the only Truth that will set him/her free.</p>
                <p><b>Transformation is A Tough Game but Results are:</b></p>
                <p>That’s Exactly What I Deliver 🙏🏻</p>

                <p>All The Best!</p>

                <p>Why Not?</p>
                <p>(Yes, try answering this 1st.)</p>
                <p>Any & all of your answers (& examine that) are there 'coz you were deprived of the true essence of the word – Transformation!</p>
                <p>Notice, we're not talking here about "Improvement". It's very slow, time consuming & a boring thing! Atleast I feel that way & all the people coming to me feel the same.</p>
                <p>Transformation is a different, all together, Frequency! It's Intense, Powerful, Thrilling with 280+ on highway or like watching 12-D movie!!!</p>
                <p>If you're reading these words: You've lived Transformation! (I won't believe you for a single sec. if you say "No".)</p>
                <p>Only thing is, you couldn't control & maintain it so it vanished. Let's talk about it on "Koffee with MK".</p>

                <p>A reason behind, you carrying Inside you – low or no self-respect, unworthiness, mostly anxious, short tempered etc. etc. etc. – can easily be traced back to the whip called "Responsibility".</p>

It breaks my heart but, You very well might still be in that trap & unknowingly using it & trapping others as well. If you've kids or people working for you... you might want to re-evaluate your dealings with them. It may sadden your heart despite any reasons your mind presents & if it does you & me are on the same page, if not earlier but for sure Now!</p>

                <p>it is Hereditary. </p>
                <p>XYZ is Responsible for you. A statement made with untruth in it's core. Why? It has Never & Will Never Free anyone. Misery, continues subconscious depression that people are going through including our Parents & Grand Parents is tagged & tagged responsibility! Let's Die "Tagged" - Talking about Moksha & Spiritual Freedom - Liberationnnn. </p>
                <p>Knowing, No one is Responsible for you.</p>
                <p>That's True Freedom!</p>
                <p>Now Handle That! You TOUGH Gal/Guy! Can You?? Oh... You said you can. </p>
                <p>Anyone who truly can, has become blissful/peaceful with himself and most importantly, to one's Life's Biggest Relief - With OTHERS! His relation with known & unknown has become cheerful & peaceful. </p>
                <p>Tackling "Work" as an example:</p>
                <p>Who all are here to work?</p>
                <p>With Work comes Responsibility & comes Rules & Penalties which oversees you like a Master</p>
                <p>In olden days there was a word that was carried by unfortunates, dragged along in blood, till their death... & the word was, "A Slave".</p>
                <p>DNA carried forward:</p>
                <p>Work = Slavery.</p>
                <p>Doesn't matter 10,000 or 1 crore salary. A subliminal speech running behind head - "You're a slave..."</p>
                <p>Now, what do slaves always wanted? </p>
                <p>It's what they wanted billions of years ago, it's what they wanted some decades ago, today & till eternity...</p>

                <p>With me so far?</p>
                <p>---------</p>
                <p>Face it, as it is in Your Face: We have already lived like a dog – Docile, Tail Wagger, occasional bark etc. And since your childhood you've already thought of dying more than 100 times till now. And If you're reading this then listen with your ears wide open – Nobody gives a shit what you've gone through & neither do I...!</p>
