                    <p>"Sufferings" are a part of life – But, some people want to achieve Distinction in that! Congrats to them all, as they succeeded & made 'Sufferings' a good 80% part of their lives. But the hot news is: Some wanted to be part of that Inner Circle so they went ahead & scored 95%!! (Bravo – Cheersss, Applause).</p>

                    <p>Something Genius — Mind.</p>
                    <p>Mind in raw terms, is an accumulation of memories. Part of which turned, out-of-control, creating a Havoc; A Rebel on loose creating disintegration of self with the greetings, "Welcome to Hell.</p>
                    <p>Inside Hell: Putting a leash on those past rough & painful moments or even present emotional sufferings – Isn't achieved via. "prayers" accompanied with Offerings of: Sedatives, nicotine, alcohol or LSDs – so stop playing footsie with it, 'coz these along with others & so called counseling gimmicks, Advancely Confuses & Distorts – this time – not only that rebel part of your mind, but – Your Entire Logical Mind! </p>
                    <p>Makes some sense so far? </p>

                <p>The standpoint from where you are — You Both Are. Then why conflicts, disagreements, mis-emotions, feeling of ill will, vengeance etc.</p>
                <p>“Lack of Acknowledgement.”</p>
                <p>The only ingredient above Right or Wrong ever there was, is: “Acknowledgement”.</p>
                <p>In other words before something could be considered and stated right or wrong — 1st comes — “Acknowledgement.”</p>
                <p>How does it go? We need to get the true meaning of the word 1st:</p>
                <p>“Acknowledgement”: “To take notice of. To make known the receipt of.” (Merriam-Webster Dictionary.)</p>
                <p>In essence it is letting the other person know that whatever he’s saying or feeling — has been Noted and Understood. Both written and verbal communications are participated-in by an Acknowledgement.</p>
                <p>For example Jason and Smith are colleagues in a Company:</p>
                <p>Joe: “My life has many issues: family, money, health and of course promotion.”</p>
                <p>Peter: “I can relate to that.” (Acknowledgement.)</p>
                <p>Joe: “We’re having a family get together this weekend.”</p>
                <p>Peter: “That’s Great.” (Acknowledgement.)</p>
                <p>Now let’s see a few examples with NO Acknowledgement:</p>
                <p>Peter: “I’m having a severe headache today.”</p>
                <p>John: “You still have to finish the job.” (No Acknowledgement.)</p>
                <p>John: “I think I should start something at my own.”</p>
                <p>Peter: “Nice plan to be a bankrupt.” (No Acknowledgement.)</p>
                <p>Most people have never been introduced to the concept of “Acknowledgement” and because of their urge to participate in the conversation they end up commenting, making fun and at worst criticizing other person’s viewpoint.</p>
                <p><b>Good, Healthy Business and Social Communications — Start, Continue and End with Acknowledgements.</b></p>
                <p>Hope it was of some use.</p>

                <p>- H E L P -</p>
                <p>How does people look to you, when you are “Sad”?</p>
                <p>That’s how they look to me — Happy!!</p>
                <p>- When you are Sad everyone else seems to be “Happier” -</p>
                <p>When a person is Sad, and he looks outside the window or he is walking down the street or he is attending a party or is in any environment where there are people around him — he looks at these people and finds them — Happy!</p>
                <p>We are compassionate Beings! We look around and can see there are people who are stressed with the usual issues of work, money, health, family, society etc.</p>
                <p>But ironically, when You are Sad and you see these people, they look — Happy! What a shift, in the way one views.</p>
                <p>As you know: In the play called Life there are ups and downs And if you got a little more understanding of the Downs may be you won’t be hard on yourself or others.</p>
                <p>To Experiment: Next time you find yourself feeling Sad or it’s “one of those days” : <b>Just look at the people around you and see how they seem to you?</b></p>
                <p>Now as an experiment it’s fine but it isn’t any way out for someone who’s feeling “Sad or Low”?</p>
                <p><b>Let me tell you what I experienced today:</b> I got up in the morning and for some reason(which i don’t have a clue) was at an emotional low. I thought this might change after I got ready- but no luck- that feeling didn’t go away. Ate breakfast, hoping to feel the motor kicking in but — NO and I continued to still feel dispirited.</p>
                <p>Didn’t even want to Listen to Music! And I’m one of those people who likes to have the music playing even before I put on my seatbelt. So I decided to put in some hours of study hoping that the productivity would pull me up and out… Not much happened though.</p>
                <p>Now I was avoiding people and did not want to interact with them. Not because of them but because I did not want them to perceive me “Differently” to what they are used to.</p>
                <p>Now, what happened afterwards was interesting!!</p>
                <p>Later in that day, I met someone who was in trouble.</p>
                <p>As a doctor cannot be a patient when he sees a patient on the opposite side of the table; so being a ‘Personal Coach’, I met that person Professionally and offered a Personal Coaching Session.</p>
                <p>We started the session and we did 2 Practicals and he moved out of his Sad and Discouraged feelings! The problem that had brought him so low became just a problem that just needed a solution… which he shared with me. And seeing the brightness and smile on his face I knew I had done what was needed and ended the Session.</p>
                <p>So, What happened with me?</p>
                <p><b>My Day Changed!</b> There was no trace of sadness or whatever else was clouding me. I was Back!</p>
                <p>So, what did happen? What did I do?</p>
                <p><b>I Helped Someone Who Needed A Hand. </b> And in doing so, I got myself back in the Game! That’s All I Did.</p>
                <p> <b>Now, Another Practical Experiment you want try out: </b></p>
                <p>Situation: In a Bad Mood, Feeling Low or Sad.</p>
                <p>To Do: Find someone around you who might need a hand? Help him out. May be find another person and help him too a bit & over the call help someone with something too and unwrap all the WOWs awaiting for YOU.</p>
                <p>There might be many other ways to be Back in Top Gear, but I simply <b>Loved </b> this One!</p>
                <p>Affectionately,</p>
